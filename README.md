## Getting Started

In order to start developing on this project, clone the `master` branch
or download the latest release souce code and run the installer. All files
will be installed in `/usr/share/PyChat/`. Do not try to run it from other
directories because some paths have been hardcoded, we'll fix this soon!

```
pip3 install pycairo
pip3 install PyGObject
pip3 install pygtk
```

Also `python3.7` is required.

### Installing

Just run the install script:

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

You should not get any output.

## Running the tests

In order to run a client with server capabilities run:

```
pychat -s
```

If you want a simple client:

```
pychat
```
